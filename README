Twitter common libraries for the jvm

Building requires:
+ jdk 1.6+
+ ant 1.8+

The build tool is custom and hosted in the repository itself.  It requires the
mako templating engine and will ask you to install the mako package if you
don't already have it in your python environment.

== Usage ==

To build all jvm code and run all tests:
$ ./pants goal test tests/{java,scala}/com/twitter/common::

To get help on pants:
$ ./pants help
