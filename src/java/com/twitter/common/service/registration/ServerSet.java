/**
 * A server set provides real-time membership status of a set of servers.
 * One use case is for all servers in a cluster to join a server set
 * enabling clients to connect to some server in the server set.
 *
 * The members of a server set are likely to be up but it is not guaranteed.
 *
 * A server set is constructed with a "location".
 * Any server joining a server set at location will show up in all other server sets
 * constructed with the same location. If two equal servers join the same server set,
 * a listener on the server set will see one or the other in the set.
 *
 * A server can unjoin a server set to remove itself from the server set.
 * However, if a server is killed or becomes unresponsive before it can unjoin,
 * it may automatically be removed from the server set.
 *
 * The server set can be "connected" or "disconnected". While disconnected, the server
 * set membership will remain unchanged.
