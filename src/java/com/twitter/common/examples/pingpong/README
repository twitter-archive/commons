Running pingpong tests:

./pants goal test tests/java/com/twitter/common/examples/pingpong

Running the pingpong example, pinging itself:
(NOTE: this command may not work due to issue 160.
If so, skip to 'Workaround'.)

./pants goal run src/java/com/twitter/common/examples/pingpong \
    --jvm-run-args="-http_port=8888 -ping_target=localhost:8888"

Workaround:
Due to issue 160, it may be necessary to use the bundle target and run the
bundle jar directly:
./pants goal bundle \
    src/java/com/twitter/common/examples/pingpong:pingpong-app
java -jar dist/pingpong-bundle/pingpong.jar -http_port=8888 \
    -ping_target=localhost:8888

Initiate the pingpong sequence:
$ curl localhost:8888/ping/hello
