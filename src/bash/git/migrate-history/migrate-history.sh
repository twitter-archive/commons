# This is a script to migrate a git repository to a subdirectory of
# another, while preserving history.

# I would like to use git subtree, but git subtree doesn't rewrite
# imported history, so files appear to move.  That means that git log
# on the subdirectory won't work.  You have to do git log --follow to
# see the history of a file, and you can only do that on an individual
# file basis.

# Also, I'm not sure what git subtree does with non-linear history.
# Git rebase fails on fake conflicts as it attempts cross the streams
# (that is, rewrite history as if it were all one branch).  And many
# projects have non-linear history on master.

# So instead I use the git plumbing commands to build a new commit for
# every commit on the imported tree.  The new commit contains the
# original commit's tree within its tree object.  So, it's basically a
# multibranch, cross-repo rebase.

# This stuff is for bash 3 compatibility; bash 4 has associative
# arrays.

Usage: migrate-history.sh [-b branch] [-s subdir] <path-to-immigrant>"

Migrate the repository at <path-to-repo> into this repository at
subdir.  If -s is omitted, it will be the basename of
<path-to-repo>.

You can use -b to get a branch other than master from the immigrant.
This repository's master will always be used.

Run this script from inside your repository, at the root directory.  The
result will be a branch named migrated-\$subdir
