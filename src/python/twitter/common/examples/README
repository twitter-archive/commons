Building the pingpong example:

./pants src/python/twitter/common/examples:pingpong

Running pingpong tests:

./pants tests/python/twitter/common/examples -v

Running the pingpong example (in two separate windows):
dist/pingpong.pex --http_port=12345 --target_port=12346
dist/pingpong.pex --http_port=12346 --target_port=12345

Then curl http://localhost:12345/ping/hello/10 to start a pingpong.

To see diagnostics, just point your browser to:
  http://localhost:12345/vars
  http://localhost:12345/threads
  http://localhost:12345/profile (requires you to start app with --app_profiling)

You can also start the application with --app_debug to see
twitter.common.app startup and teardown.  Lastly, you can leverage portions
of PEX files to introspect the application:

To see the PEX environment setup:
  PEX_VERBOSE=1 dist/pingpong.pex --help

To run an interpreter in the environment of the PEX file:
  PEX_INTERPRETER=1 dist/pingpong.pex
